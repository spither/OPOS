            <p>One Planet Living is a vision of a sustainable world, in which people everywhere can enjoy a high quality of life within the productive capacity of the planet, with space left for wildlife and wilderness.</p>
            <p>One Planet Living uses ecological and carbon footprinting, along with a framework of ten guiding principles, to help individuals, organisations and governments to examine the sustainability challenges that they face, by benchmarking their impacts, and make a plan to live within a fair share of the resources available.</p>
            <p>Organisations around the world are using the one planet living approach to take measurable steps towards genuine sustainability. From zero carbon buildings to procurement policies that support the green economy, one planet living solutions are cost-effective, creative, inspirational and replicable.</p>
